This is a prototype for a Desktop-only Notes UI I developed on my free time. It has very basic funcionality, and a simple text editor.

**This is NOT meant to replace your Notes editor üòÅ Use at your own risk.**

### Not working yet:

* Persistence üíæ. Everything you do will be lost when you reload the page.
* Adding notes üòÖ
* sort folders

### Things you can do:

* edit notes (highligh text to show options, or use common keyboard shortcuts)
* search notes
* add images to the editor (though still very primitive)
* add/edit/rename folders
* resize the panels


## How to run locally

```
git clone https://github.com/vitormv/notas.git notas
cd notas
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can also try out a Electron version of the app by running:
```
yarn electron
```
